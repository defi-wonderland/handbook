# Privacy by default

In everyday life, privacy is the default for most transactions. When you use cash the exchange is between you and the merchant, and no one else gets to see your financial history. The early design of blockchains like Ethereum took a different path. Its public by default nature was a powerful feature for transparency and auditability, but it came at a significant cost:  a financial system where every user's activity is exposed for all to see. This lack of inherent privacy is not just an inconvenience, it's a foundational barrier to mainstream adoption.

It's worth noting this problem extends far beyond simple finance. As an Ethereum account becomes your root digital identity for social logins, governance, and credentials, a public transaction history means a public life. This permanent public record of every interaction creates an environment for tracking and analysis, a reality that feels increasingly at odds with the goal of a free and open digital society.

This raises an important question. How do we balance useful transparency with the fundamental need for privacy? The answer lies in **privacy by default**. This means building systems that protect users automatically, making privacy the effortless, baseline option rather than the difficult chore it is today. You shouldn't need to be a cryptography expert to have a private transaction.

For years, this was more of a theoretical goal than a practical one. This has changed, driven by real breakthroughs in cryptography. It wasn't just a lack of focus, the technology itself wasn't ready. Now, more efficient ZK-SNARK systems mean that the process of generating proofs is no longer a major bottleneck for many applications. The key insight here is that the technology is finally practical. Protocols like **Privacy Pools** use these advances to show a path where we can have transactional privacy while allowing users to prove their funds are not tied to illicit activity. This demonstrates we can have smart, nuanced privacy.

The rise of large scale data analysis and AI means that transaction patterns can be traced back to real people more easily. The partial privacy we thought we had is disappearing. The hopeful part is that the user's wallet is the perfect place to fix this. Since the wallet is the primary interface to the entire ecosystem, building privacy directly into it protects millions of users automatically. We can make privacy so seamless it just happens.

This chapter of the handbook is an attempt to map out that specific path. We will explore how a wallet can integrate a protocol like **Privacy Pools** to deliver a seamless, one click privacy experience, turning it from an abstract feature into a simple tool. The promise of crypto was always about creating sovereign individuals free from centralized control. Without privacy, that promise is incomplete.
