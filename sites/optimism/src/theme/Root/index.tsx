          This handbook is not intended to replace Optimism's documentation.
          This is the internal material we use at Wonderland to onboard new
          people working with Optimism as a core development member. We open
          source it in the hopes that it helps somebody else, but beware it can
          be outdated on the latest updates. For the most up-to-date
          information, please refer to the official Optimism documentation at{" "}
