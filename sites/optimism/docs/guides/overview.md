# Development Guidelines

This section provides technical guidelines and best practices for writing code and tests in the Optimism ecosystem.

Whether you're implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, these guidelines will help you write code that is secure and consistent with the standards that shape how we build together.

We'll cover:

- **Coding Practices**: Code organization, patterns, and conventions across Solidity.
- **Testing Standards**: How to write effective tests for smart contracts, following strict linting rules and Optimism standards.

These guidelines complement the [Processes](../processes/overview.md) section, which covers workflows and phases of development. Here, we focus on the craft: what your code should look like, how to test it, and the habits that make you a stronger contributor.

## Guidelines Available

### [Coding Guidelines](./coding-guidelines.md)

Standards for writing clean, readable, and secure code. Includes conventions for Solidity, design patterns, gas optimization, and documentation practices.

### [Testing Guidelines](./testing-guidelines.md)

Learn how to write tests that catch bugs early, cover edge cases. Covers unit tests, integration tests, fuzzing, and best practices for Foundry.

## Getting Started

If you're new to the project, we recommend:

1. Read through the [Processes](../processes/overview.md) to understand the development workflow
2. Review the [Coding Guidelines](./coding-guidelines.md) to understand our standards
3. Consult the [Testing Guidelines](./testing-guidelines.md) before writing your first tests
