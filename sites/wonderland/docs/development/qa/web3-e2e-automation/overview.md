# Web3 E2E automation

Web3 E2E (end-to-end) automation focuses on testing decentralized applications (dApps) from a user’s perspective, validating how smart contracts, wallets, frontends, and blockchain nodes interact in real-world scenarios. This type of automation typically involves tools like Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium, combined with test wallets, mock chains, or real testnets.

## Best Practices

Best practices in E2E automation testing ensure that the testing process is efficient, reliable, maintainable, and scalable. Without them, automated tests can quickly become fragile, slow, or difficult to manage, defeating the purpose of automation.
