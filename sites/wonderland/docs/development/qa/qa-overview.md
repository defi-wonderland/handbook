# Overview

Our quality assurance (QA) process combines different testing approaches to verify functionality, usability, and reliability. Effective QA strategies balance human expertise with automation, while also considering potential risks to focus testing efforts where they will have the greatest impact.

A healthy testerâ€™s mindset is inherently pessimistic: always assuming something could go wrong, questioning every assumption, and seeking the flaws hidden beneath the surface.

The following are three key approaches that work together to deliver comprehensive quality coverage:

- [Manual testing](/docs/development/qa/manual-testing-process): Involves executing test cases and scenarios by hand. It allows testers to apply human judgment, adapt to unexpected results, and identify issues where human insight is essential.
- [Automated testing](/docs/development/qa/web3-e2e-automation/overview): Provides fast, repeatable validation of stable and critical functionalities, enabling early detection of regressions.
- [Risk-based testing](/docs/development/qa/risk-based-testing): Prioritizes efforts on areas with the highest potential impact or likelihood of failure, ensuring resources are focused where they matter most.

This approach balances efficiency, depth, and coverage, delivering reliable results while optimizing testing effort.
