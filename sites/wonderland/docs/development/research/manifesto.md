# How we work together.

## 1. Own your output 🫳

We’re responsible for what we write, what we ship, and the gaps in between. If we’re part of a project and there’s no research, we create it. If we’re writing a spec and the idea draft is outdated, we fix it. We don’t wait for someone else to notice the hole; we patch it.

## 2. Stay in the lifecycle 🔁

Research **SHOULD NOT** show up halfway through a project. We're there at the beginning, the end, and everywhere in between. From background reading to post-launch notes, we help shape every project. **If we’re not in the room, we find a way in. If we’re missing context, we ask. If no one wrote it down, we do.**

## 3. Communicate clearly ☎️

No ghosting. No guessing. We keep our tools updated and our teammates looped in. We use Linear for tracking. We use Discord to unblock and hand off. We use Notion to keep our work readable after we forget what it was about.

**If no one knows what we’re doing, they can’t help us or rely on us.**

## 4. Follow the structure 🧾

Templates exist for a reason. We use them. We don’t start from scratch unless the format truly doesn’t fit. We make our work easy to scan, reuse, and review. We’re writing specs, drafts, and research that help others think better.

## 5. Give useful feedback 🤝

Reviewing is part of the job. We don’t need to be the smartest people in the room, just honest, specific, and clear. We also take feedback without turning it into a debate.

**The goal is shared clarity, so we keep the ego aside.**

## 6. Track and own your work 🔎

Every task, draft, or review has an owner. If we pick something up, we update it. If it’s ours, we keep it moving. **We DO NOT** let things drift or live in DM threads. **Visibility is part of accountability.**

## 7. Support people who just joined 🫂

If someone’s new, we check in. If they’re lost, we help. If something’s unclear, we write it down so they don’t have to ask twice.

**We don’t grow by expecting people to figure it out alone.**

## 8. Protect your thinking time 🧠

Research is the brain behind everything that has yet to be created. We protect our thinking time! Even when our goals are incremental improvements, we carve out space to think deeply about the next big leap. It's important to take our time and rest when necessary. 

## 9. Be creative 🎨

We think out of the box and go beyond the things Wonderland is doing today. If there is something we think we should be doing, **we propose it.** Is it a feature? Is it a new partner? **We share it.** 

## 10. Trust in ourselves and others 🚀

We rely on our experience and judgment to do our best work, and we trust our teammates to do the same. We share information openly so everyone is in the loop and able to contribute effectively.
