# Research Overview

Welcome. This section explains how Research fits across the project lifecycle and how we create value (from background work to design reviews and post‑launch notes). If you’re new, skim the [Project Lifecycle](https://handbook.defi.sucks/docs/processes/project-lifecycle) first.

## What's Inside
- **Manifesto**: The core values we expect from the research team.
- **Technical Writing**: Guidelines and examples for clear specs, drafts, and reviews
- **Onboarding**: Resources and challenges for new researchers
  - Knowledge Base: Essential concepts and references
  - Challenges: Hands-on exercises aligned to real work
