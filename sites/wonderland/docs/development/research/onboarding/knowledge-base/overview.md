# The Fundamentals

This page is your starting point for the onboarding. It’s organized into four sections: **Basics**, **Intermediate**, **DeFi**, and **Core**. Each section contains topics to explore, along with resources and tools to help you build a strong foundation.

Start with the **Basics** and work your way through the sections at your own pace. Use the links in each category to access articles, guides, and practical examples —we **really** suggest that you engage with the resources. Once you're ready, move on to the **Onboarding Challenge** to apply what you’ve learned.

::: tip Each section has its own set of challenges. Make sure to complete and surface each one before moving on to the next section.
