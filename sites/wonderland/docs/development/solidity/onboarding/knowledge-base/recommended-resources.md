Working in DeFi often means standing on the shoulders of giants and using existing code to speed up development. Some contracts are forked more often than others, and with time, they become famous or influential.

:::tip Ecosystem Awareness
Understanding these foundational contracts and standards is crucial for DeFi development. When you encounter similar patterns in protocols, you will recognize the battle-tested approaches that have shaped the ecosystem.

## 🏗️ Foundational Contracts

These are the contracts that have shaped DeFi and continue to influence new protocols:

### Core Infrastructure
- [Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds) - The global standard for blockchain connectivity.
- [Connext](https://docs.connext.network/) - Cross-chain communication protocol.
- [Gnosis Safe Multisig](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/tree/main/contracts) - Multi-signature wallet standard used across DeFi.
- [OpenZeppelin Library](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/) - The gold standard for secure, audited implementations.

### DeFi Primitives
- [Synthetix](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/develop/contracts/StakingRewards.sol) - Staking rewards pattern used across protocols.
- [UniswapV4 Hooks](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/concepts/hooks) - Next-generation AMM extensibility.
- [Aave](https://aave.com/docs) - DeFi's largest lending network.

Some of the contracts and concepts above are pretty advanced, it is ok if you do not understand them completely. Just keep in mind that they exist for when you need them.

## 📚 Essential Standards & Concepts

These are the building blocks that define the DeFi ecosystem:

### Ethereum Improvements
- [EIP-1559: Fee market change](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) - Understanding gas pricing mechanics.
- [EIP-7702: Set Code for EOAs](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702) - Givin EOAs super powers.

### Ecosystem Standards
- [ERC-3643: The Token Standard for RWA Tokenization](https://www.erc3643.org/) - Real-world asset tokenization.
- [ERC-4337: Account Abstraction](https://www.erc4337.io/) - Smart account infrastructure.
- [ERC4626 vault](https://erc4626.info/) - The vault standard that revolutionized yield-bearing tokens.

### Contract Creation Patterns
- [CREATE, CREATE2, CREATE3](https://blog.solichain.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-create-create2-and-create3-cc6fe71c6d40) - Deterministic contract deployment.
- [CREATEX](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/createx?tab=readme-ov-file) - Advanced deployment patterns.

Don't worry about understanding everything at once. Focus on the patterns that appear most frequently in the ecosystem, then expand your knowledge as you encounter new challenges.
