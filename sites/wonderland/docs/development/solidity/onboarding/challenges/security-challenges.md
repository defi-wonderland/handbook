# Security

Flawed logic will be exploited in smart contracts, particularly when funds are involved. Therefore, it is crucial for developers to understand the intricacies of the field and learn not to write code just to finish a task. Hasty programming as well as a lack of grasp of the potential attacks employed to exploit smart contracts are recipes for disaster.

In this section of the onboarding, our goal is to familiarize you with the most common attacks and attempt to implant the security mindset into your brain. We don't expect you to be an expert—this is a different profession altogether—but we do expect you to be conscious of the code you're writing.
