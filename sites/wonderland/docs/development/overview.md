# Welcome to the Development Section 👩‍💻

We live in a space where code is law, and law is fragile.

At Wonderland, we care about crafting systems that last. Every line we write carries consequences, sometimes financial, sometimes reputational, sometimes ethical.

> We believe great engineering happens at the intersection of curiosity and discipline.

That means saying _no_ to shortcuts. That means understanding why code patterns matter, why onboarding isn't a formality, and why tests are not an afterthought. We do not separate writing from thinking, or thinking from responsibility.

Here, you'll find the foundations of how we build:

- How we onboard people across roles
- What we expect in Solidity, frontend, and offchain code
- How we write and share research with clarity and care

Each of these domains is a lens through which we can strengthen the system. And when in doubt, we come back to the one principle that matters most:

**Build like it will be attacked.**
