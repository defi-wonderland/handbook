# Ethos

At Wonderland, we believe that the ecosystem thrives on collaboration and shared knowledge. This handbook is our living repository—a curated guide to our best practices, processes, and technical insights. We're proud of the work we do, and we're committed to fostering transparency and trust within the community.

This handbook is for **Wonderland contributors**, **devs**, **partners, organizations** and **anyone** eager to learn about best practices in development and security. Whether you're refining your testing workflow, bolstering your security practices, or diving into offchain and solidity style guidelines, **this guide has something for you.**

So let's dive in and **stay safe**—for ourselves, for the community, and the future of Web3 🐇✨
