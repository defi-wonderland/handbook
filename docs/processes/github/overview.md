# GitHub

For us Github is the space where we structure our projects and the way we manage these things directly affects the security, clarity, and resilience of our systems.

This section documents how we collaborate safely and intentionally across teams, repos, and projects.

You’ll find:
- **Environment setup** — including anon Git and SSH config
- **PR etiquette** — how to open, structure, and review pull requests
- **Repo hygiene** — readiness checklists, branching, and release flows
- **Commit discipline** — how small changes shape big systems

> We believe great code is written twice: first in the `.sol` file, and then again — with equal care — in the pull request that brings it to life.

This guide exists to make sure both are held to the same standard.
