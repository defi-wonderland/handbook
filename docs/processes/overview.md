# Great software it’s forged through process.

At Wonderland, we treat process as product. The way we plan, the way we review, the way we commit. All of it shapes what we ship. And in a world where small oversights can have massive consequences, we don’t leave this part of the system to chance.

This section outlines the core workflows that make our projects safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain.

You'll find:
- **Project Lifecycle** — the scaffolding that turns ideas into launch-ready protocols
- **GitHub Guidelines** — how we work together through PRs, commits, and repos

> The best developers shape the system around the code. This section shows you how we do that.
