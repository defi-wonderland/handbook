# **Welcome to the Offchain Onboarding**

This onboarding process is designed to provide you with the necessary knowledge, best practices, and development standards required to contribute effectively to our projects.

The onboarding is divided into two key sections:

- [Knowledge Base](/docs/development/offchain/onboarding/knowledge-base): A guide covering coding standards, best practices, and essential tools.
-  [Coding Challenge](/docs/development/offchain/onboarding/challenge): A challenge where you will build an Uniswap V2 Multichain TVL Aggregator.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Comms

- All the questions regarding the challenge or anything should go in the `#new-team-member-onboarding-channel` within the onboarding section in Wonderland‚Äôs discord server.
- Anyone who is available will answer your questions.

## üìé Tracking

Your onboarding progress will be tracked through **Linear** issues assigned to you at the start of the process. Each section will have its own set of challenges to track your learning and application.
