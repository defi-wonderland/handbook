# Welcome to the Frontend Onboarding!

This onboarding process is designed to provide you with the necessary knowledge, best practices, and development standards required to contribute effectively to our frontend projects.

The onboarding is divided into two key sections:

- A comprehensive guide covering DeFi concepts, security protocols, and essential development tools.
    
    [Frontend Knowledge Base](/docs/development/frontend/onboarding/front-knowledge-base)
    
- A practical challenge to assess and refine your frontend development skills.
    
    [Frontend Development Challenge](/docs/development/frontend/onboarding/frontend-dev-challenge)

## üõ∞Ô∏è Communication

- All questions regarding the challenge or anything else should go in the `#<YOUR_NAME>-onboarding` thread in the onboarding channel in Wonderland's Discord server.
- Team members will respond to your questions as they become available.

## üìé Progress Tracking

Your onboarding progress will be tracked through **Linear** issues assigned to you at the start of the process. Each section will have its own set of tasks to monitor your learning and application.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Review the Knowledge Base section first to familiarize yourself with our standards and practices before moving on to the Development Challenge. Remember, this process is designed not only to evaluate your technical skills but also to help you integrate into our collaborative development culture.
