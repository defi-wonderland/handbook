- [Synthetix Staking](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/develop/contracts/StakingRewards.sol) - Reference implementation for staking rewards
- [UniswapV2 Pair](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol) - Foundational DEX contract
- [Gnosis Safe Multisig](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/tree/main/contracts) - Leading multisignature wallet implementation
- [Sushi MasterChef](https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/archieve/canary/contracts/MasterChef.sol) - Popular farming/staking contract
- [ERC4626 vault](https://erc4626.info/) - Standard for tokenized vaults
