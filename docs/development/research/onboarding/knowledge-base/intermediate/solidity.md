# Solidity in a Nutshell

This page serves as a starting point for learning Solidity. It includes recommended resources and challenges to support your learning journey. While it’s not expected to complete everything during the onboarding period, you’re welcome to explore and work through it at your own pace.

Feel free to use this section as a reference throughout your onboarding or whenever you want to deepen your knowledge of Solidity.

## Why learning Solidity

As a researcher, it’s important to have the ability to read and understand Solidity code, along with a grasp of the language’s basic nuances. You don’t need to dive deep into advanced technical details, but it’s crucial to be aware of common security concerns and issues in writing smart contracts.

This foundational knowledge will help you analyze protocols more effectively and contribute to discussions on smart contract design and evaluation.

## General resources

### Starting from scratch — **this *must** be addressed during the onboarding.*

1. **Blockchain Basics (Cyfrin Updraft)**
    
    Begin with this course to build foundational knowledge about blockchain concepts. While the initial sections may feel introductory, the content from **Section 15 to Section 23** provides highly valuable insights that are essential for understanding smart contract development.
