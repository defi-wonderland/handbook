# Tokenomics

## 1) Analyzing Tokenomics in DeFi

Your first tokenomics challenge consists of performing a comprehensive breakdown of the tokenomics behind **Aerodrome**, a top DeFi protocol on Base. The following aspects must be covered:

- Initial distribution/allocation of AERO
- Future supply distribution over time
- AERO/veAERO voting mechanism
- Bribes mechanism

After completing the breakdown, answer the following questions with supporting evidence:

- Who controls AERO emissions?
- What is the strategy to maximize gains in AERO?
- What is the strategy to maximize gains in USD value?
- Opinion: Is the AERO system well-designed? Justify your answer.

## 2) Consensus meets *money printing*

Your second tokenomics challenge consists of studying the Terra blockchain. Terra had a popular tokenomic system where the main token, LUNA, was used to secure the network via PoS, while UST functioned as its algorithmic stablecoin. The following aspects must be covered:

- Initial distribution/allocation of LUNA and UST
- PoS mechanism using LUNA
- Governance mechanism
- Conversion mechanics between LUNA and UST

After completing the breakdown, answer the following questions with supporting evidence:

- How much is needed to perform a governance attack? How could this attack be orchestrated?
- How much is needed to perform a consensus attack? How could this attack be orchestrated?
- Who controls the UST oracle?
- Opinion: In your view, why did the Terra blockchain fail?

### **How to Submit Your Work**

- All work for your chosen challenge must be committed to the **GitHub repository** assigned to you during onboarding.
- Include diagrams/charts to illustrate key points.
- Maintain a technical focus throughout.
- No need to delve extremely deep into the underlying systems‚Äîfocus on tokenomics, and wisely manage your time.
- Structure your commits clearly, with meaningful messages that outline the progress of your work, see [Git Practices](/docs/processes/github/git-practices.md) for reference.
- Ensure your final submission is well-organized, with supporting files, diagrams, or models included as needed.
