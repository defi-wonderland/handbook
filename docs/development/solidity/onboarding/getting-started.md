# **Welcome to the Solidity Onboarding**

This onboarding process is designed to provide you with the necessary knowledge, best practices, and development standards required to contribute effectively to our projects.

The onboarding is divided into two key sections:

- [Knowledge Base](/docs/development/solidity/onboarding/knowledge-base): A comprehensive guide covering coding standards, best practices, and essential tools.
-  [Coding Challenges](/docs/development/solidity/onboarding/challenges/overview): A series of Solidity and Security exercises to assess and refine your skills.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Comms

- All the questions regarding the challenge or anything should go in the `#new-team-member-onboarding-channel` within the onboarding section in Wonderland's discord server.
- Anyone who is available will answer your questions.

## üìé Tracking

Your onboarding progress will be tracked through **Linear** issues assigned to you at the start of the process. Each section will have its own set of challenges to track your learning and application.
