# Knowledge Base 

The Knowledge Base serves as the cornerstone of our onboarding process. It contains information about our organizationâ€™s coding style, best practices, and the tools we use to write, test, and maintain Solidity code. By familiarizing yourself with the Knowledge Base, you ensure that you can align with our standards and workflows.

Wonderland's standards are what make us unique. Adhering to these best practices is a critical part of onboarding and should be approached with diligence and care.

## Essential Resources

### Git & Development Practices
Start by reviewing our [Git Practices](docs/processes/github/git-practices.md) guide, which outlines our software management processes and best practices. Also, take a look at [the Pull Request Guidelines](docs/processes/github/pr-guidelines.md).

### Coding Standards
Next, familiarize yourself with our core coding standards:
- [NatSpec Best Practices](docs/development/solidity/natspec.md)
- [Solidity Coding Style](docs/development/solidity/coding-style.md)
- [Gas Optimization Guide](https://www.rareskills.io/post/gas-optimization)

### Testing Framework
Testing is fundamental to our development process. Learn about:
- Our approach to [Unit and Integration Testing](docs/testing/unit-integration.md) with Foundry
- Our [Solidity Foundry Boilerplate](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/solidity-foundry-boilerplate) - our starter template for Solidity projects

Once you're comfortable with these guidelines, you'll be ready to tackle the challenges!
