# Natspec

NatSpec comments are an essential part of writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented Solidity code. They are critical not only for internal and external auditors but also for other developers and users interacting with your contracts. Additionally, tools like `forge doc` and `Etherscan` can parse NatSpec comments to generate documentation, making function parameters, return values, and contract behaviour easier to understand. 

More importantly, NatSpec's machine-readability coupled with `natspec-smells`  allows us to enforce completeness and consistency, ensuring that documentation is both comprehensive and aligned with the contractâ€™s actual functionality. This not only improves clarity but also helps catch missing or inaccurate details.

## **Tool**

To enforce the adoption of high-quality NatSpec comments and catch issues early, Wonderland has developed the NatSpec-Smells tool: https://github.com/defi-wonderland/natspec-smells. Some features are:

- Ensures that all constructors, variables, functions, structs, errors, events, and modifiers have proper NatSpec comments.
- Finds and reports misspelled or missing @param or @return annotations.
- Verifies that public and external functions include the @inheritdoc tag when inheriting documentation from base contracts.
